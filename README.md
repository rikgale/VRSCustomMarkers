# VRSCustomMarkers
Custom SVG Aircraft and Boat markers for Virtual Radar Server - forked from [shish0r/VRSCustomMarkers](https://github.com/shish0r/VRSCustomMarkers) Thanks :)


**Only** works on V3 VRS - which supports SVG aircraft markers.



## Installing

The following instructions are for a VRS installed on Linux - installing on windows should be very similar.


1) Ensure that the Custom Content Plugin is installed and enabled.
2) Download [MyMarkers1.html](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rikgale/VRSCustomMarkers/main/MyMarkers1.html) (follow link then right-clink -> SAVE AS) into the CustomContent/CustomInjectedFiles folder of your VRS instalation.
3) In the Custom Content Plugin add an injection for the MyMarkers1.html  (Drop down to 4. below)

4) Ensure that your VRS is set up to serve SVG images. If you do not have the SVG boxes checked then your VRS will serve .png files and this will have no effect.

5) Refresh your VRS web-page and it should be working.
